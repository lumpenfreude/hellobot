# hellobot 
a [maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) specifically for saying hi to new people on a server 
i couldn't figure out how to get [reactbot](https://github.com/maubot/reactbot/) to react to new people on a server, like i'd gotten [robotovarisch](https://github.com/lumpenfreude/robotovarisch) to do, so i figured i'd write a quick bot to just. do. that thing. lol. 
## how to use
i don't know yet
